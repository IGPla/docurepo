# Calculus

## Notes

- We will call J our sample function
- delta(J(w, b)) / delta(w) is the derivative (slope) of J(w, b) function in w direction (partial derivative). It's commonly used in optimization problems
- we use "delta" instead of "d" as derivative notation when functions have partial derivatives

## Intuition example

Let f(x) = 3x

d(f(x)) / d(x) = 3

It is calculated with limit calculus. The idea behind it is simple. Just take 2 points in your function, and calculate the slope between them. That slope is calculated easyly, because it forms a triangle. That triangle slope is height / width.

So, once the previous step is done, applying the limit there, just taking closest points on every step will give an increasing better approximation of the real slope. Using limit calculus, you can define the final value of the slope (that is a function)

g(x) = x^2

d(g(x)) / d(x) = 2x
